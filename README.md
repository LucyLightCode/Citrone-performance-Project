# Citrone-performance-Project


### Introduction
This project trains a machine learning model that will predict if a student will graduate / move from the beginner class to the intermediate class or not from the Stutern learning management platform (Citrone)

The columns in the dataset include:

 - S/N : Serial Number
 - Name : Names of Student
 - Email: Student's email address
 - Address: Student's Address during Application
 - Lesson Summary: Date column
 - Quiz Summary
 - Assignment Summary	Grade Point Average	Intermediate class Eligibility

Due to the limited data point available for the initial training of the model, more data were generated random online from this website, the data were generated to reflect real world stutern student's data.
Downloaded dummy data from [https://www.mockaroo.com/] to add to the existing data, so as to make the machine learning model perform very well


# Conclusions
A complete data science process was carried out on the Citrone dataset.

The dataset was appropriately cleaned. Some of the columns were dropped to make the analysis quick and concise. Various statistical summaries like histogram plots, correlation plots, and scatter plots were plotted to show the relationship between different columns and make the data fit for machine learning models.

Machine learning models were trained with 80% of the data and tested on 20% of the data. The models performed well with more than 90% accuracy on the test dataset. The model was evaluated and deployed to evaluate its performance.
